Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

   1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
        At Global Rain, you are tasked with working with a client, Artemis Financial. Your client is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. 
        Artemis Financial desires to modernize its operations and, as a crucial part of the success of its custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and is seeking Global Rain’s expertise in taking steps to protect the organization from external threats.
        As part of the team, you are tasked with examining Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities in their current software. Your assessment will be used to complete a vulnerability assessment report for mitigating the security vulnerabilities that you identify.
   
   2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
        Using the dependency report, I was able to make a list of potential security issues. With that information, I can then take the next in determining which ones are
        acutally a security threat, and then take mitigating actions to solve the issue. It is important to code with security in mind, because often if you don't then that 
        leaves your software vulnerable to data extraction, third party manipulation, and most importantly financial loss. I do not want to code and have to come back later 
        to apply practices that should have been put their in the first place. 
        
   4. What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
        My take away from the vulnerability, the challenging part was intereptating what vulnerabilitys were actually a threat and the most helpful would be the ability to make a 
        exemption xml for avoid the ones that are not a threat. 
   6. How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
        Using owasp and springboot security will help in the future for assessing vulnerability threats. The coding part will come with more time as each company will probably have different
        practices and procedures for secure coding. 
   8. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
        By running and starting the server with a self-signed certificate and a dependency reprot. By creating a checksum report as well.    
   10. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
        SpringBoot, Eclipse Keytool, Springboot Security, A exemption for xml for vulnerability's that are not a threat so they do not show up repeatedly in 
        the dependency report.
   12. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
         The hash algorithm, the self signed certificate with the server working. SHA -256
